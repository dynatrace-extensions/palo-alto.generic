# Palo Alto Generic Extension
First EF2.0 extension targeting Palo Alto firewall devices

## Usage
For now go for [dev](#dev)

## Dev

### Prerequisites
- Nix-capable environment, for Windows that means [installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/2-enable-and-install)
- [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) / [**nix for WSL**](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-windows)
- Docker (available in the same environment as nix, required for running companions)

Hint: if something doesn't work because of missing package please add the package to `default.nix` instead of installing on your computer. Why solve the problem for one if you can solve the problem for all? ;)

### Everything
```
nix-shell
# caution! if this is your first pull of first extension ever this might take some time
# depending on your network connection
# after it completes: inside the shell
make help
```

### Convinience
This section is entirely **optional**. The repository contains additional amenities, but they're not so straightforward, so we don't recommend them for begginers.  Anyway, you might also like:
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) (which can be installed easily via `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.direnv`)
